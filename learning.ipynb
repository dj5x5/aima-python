    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learn about agents that can improve their behavior through diligent study of their own experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent is **learning** if it improves its performance on future tasks after making observations about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of feedback that determine the three main types of learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Supervised Learning the agent observeses some example input-output pairs and learns a function that maps from input to output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Let's think of an agent to classify images containing cats or dogs. If we provide an image containing a cat or a dog, this agent should output a string \"cat\" or \"dog\" for that particular image. To teach this agent, we will give a lot of input-output pairs like {cat image-\"cat\"}, {dog image-\"dog\"} to the aggent. The agent then learns a function that maps from an input image to one of those strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unsupervised Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unsupervised Learning the agent learns patterns in the input even though no explicit feedback is supplied. The most common type is **clustering**: detecting potential useful clusters of input examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A taxi agent would develop a concept of *good traffic days* and *bad traffic days* without ever being given labeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reinforcement Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Reinforcement Learning the agent from a series of reinforcements—rewards or punishments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Let's talk about an agent to play the popular Atari game—[Pong](http://www.ponggame.org). We will reward a point for every correct move and deduct a point for every wrong move from the agent. Eventually, the agent will figure out its actions prior to reinforcement were most responsible for it."

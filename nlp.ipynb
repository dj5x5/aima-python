For the first five classes it is impossible to list all words, since words are continuously being added in the classes. Recently \"google\" was added to the list of verbs, and words like that will continue to pop up and get added to the lists. For that reason, these first five categories are called **open classes**. The rest of the categories have much fewer words and much less development. While words like \"thou\" were commonly used in the past but have declined almost completely in usage, most changes take many decades or centuries to manifest, so we can safely assume the categories will remain static for the foreseeable future. Thus, these categories are called **closed classes**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search** (or HITS for short) is an algorithm for information retrieval and page ranking. You can read more on information retrieval in the [text notebook](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/text.ipynb). Essentially, given a collection of documents and a user's query, such systems return to the user the documents most relevant to what the user needs. The HITS algorithm differs from a lot of other similar ranking algorithms (like Google's *Pagerank*) as the page ratings in this algorithm are dependent on the given query. This means that for each new query the result pages must be computed anew. This cost might be prohibitive for many modern search engines, so a lot steer away from this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "HITS first finds a list of relevant pages to the query and then adds pages that link to or are linked from these pages. Once the set is built, we define two values for each page. **Authority** on the query, the degree of pages from the relevant set linking to it and **hub** of the query, the degree that it points to authoritative pages in the set. Since we do not want to simply count the number of links from a page to other pages, but we also want to take into account the quality of the linked pages, we update the hub and authority values of a page in the following manner, until convergence:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hub score = The sum of the authority scores of the pages it links to.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Authority score = The sum of hub scores of the pages it is linked from.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the higher quality the pages a page is linked to and from, the higher its scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then normalize the scores by dividing each score by the sum of the squares of the respective scores of all pages. When the values converge, we return the top-valued pages. Note that because we normalize the values, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge."

    "A typical example of such a system is `AskMSR` (Banko *et al.*, 2002), a system for question answering that performed admirably against more sophisticated algorithms. The basic idea behind it is that a lot of questions have already been answered in the web numerous times. The system doesn't know a lot about verbs, or concepts or even what a noun is. It knows about 15 different types of questions and how they can be written as queries. It can rewrite [Who was George Washington's second in command?] as the query [\\* was George Washington's second in command] or [George Washington's second in command was \\*].\n",
    "\n",
    "After rewriting the questions, it issues these queries and retrieves the short text around the query terms. It then breaks the result into 1, 2 or 3-grams. Filters are also applied to increase the chances of a correct answer. If the query starts with \"who\", we filter for names, if it starts with \"how many\" we filter for numbers and so on. We can also filter out the words appearing in the query. For the above query, the answer \"George Washington\" is wrong, even though it is quite possible the 2-gram would appear a lot around the query terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the different results are weighted by the generality of the queries. The result from the general boolean query [George Washington OR second in command] weighs less that the more specific query [George Washington's second in command was \\*]. As an answer we return the most highly-ranked n-gram."

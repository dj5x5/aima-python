In this and all of the below methods `self` refers to the object itself--the object whose method is called. `initial` specifies the initial state of our search problem. It represents the start state from where our agent begins his task of exploration to find the goal state(s) which is given in the `goal` parameter.\n",
    "* `actions(self, state)` : This method returns all the possible actions our agent can make in state `state`.\n",
    "* `result(self, state, action)` : This returns the resulting state if action `action` is taken in the state `state`. This `Problem` class only deals with deterministic outcomes. So we know for sure what every action in a state would result to.\n",
    "* `goal_test(self, state)` : Given a graph state, it checks if it is a terminal state. If the state is indeed a goal state, value of `True` is returned. Else, of course, `False` is returned.\n",
    "* `path_cost(self, c, state1, action, state2)` : Return the cost of the path that arrives at `state2` as a result of taking `action` from `state1`, assuming total cost of `c` to get up to `state1`.\n",

    "Now the above abstract class acts as a parent class, and there is another named called `GraphProblem` in our module. It creates a graph problem from an instance of the `Graph` class. To create a graph, simply type `graph = Graph(dict(...))`. The dictionary must contain nodes of the graph as keys, so make sure they are `hashable`. If you don't know what that means just use strings or numbers. Each node contains the adjacent nodes as keys and the edge length as its value. Each dictionary then should correspond to another dictionary in the graph.  The `Graph` class creates a directed(edges allow only one way traffic) by default. If you want to make an undirected graph, use `UndirectedGraph` instead, but make sure to mention any edge in only one of its nodes."

Rather than a `FIFO` queue, we use something called a `priority queue` which selects the element with the highest `priority` of all elements in the queue. For our problem, the shortest path between animals has the higher priority; the shortest path has the lowest path cost. Whenever we need to enqueue a node already in the queue, we will update its path cost if the newer path is better. This is a very important step, and it means that the path cost to a node may keep getting better until it is selected for expansion. This is the reason that we do a goal check only when a node is selected for expanion."

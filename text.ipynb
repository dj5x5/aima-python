    "Before we start performing text processing algorithms, we will need to build some word models. Those models serve as a look-up table for word probabilities. In the text module we have implemented two such models, which inherit from the `CountingProbDist` from `learning.py`. `UnigramTextModel` and `NgramTextModel`. We supply them with a text file and they show the frequency of the different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the two models is that the first returns the probability of one single word (eg. the probability of the word 'the' appearing), while the second one can show us the probability of a *sequence* of words (eg. the probability of the sequence 'of the' appearing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, both functions can generate random words and sequences respectively, random according to the model.\n",

We can accomplish this by employing the `Viterbi Segmentation` algorithm. It takes as input the string to segment and a text model, and it returns a list of the separate words.\n",

It accomplishes that by segmentating the string into \"windows\", each window representing a word (real or gibberish). It then calculates the probability of the sequence up that window/word occuring and updates its solution. When it is done, it traces back from the final word and finds the complete sequence of words."

This encryption lets us communicate safely, as anyone who has access to the ciphertext but doesn't know how to decode it cannot read the message. We will restrict our study to <b>Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers</b>. These are primitive forms of cipher where each letter in the message text (also known as plaintext) is replaced by another another letter of the alphabet.\n",

A shift by <b>`n`</b> in this context means that each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a letter corresponding to `n` letters down in the alphabet. For example the plaintext `\"ABCDWXYZ\"` shifted by `3` yields `\"DEFGZABC\"`. Note how `X` became `A`. This is because the alphabet is cyclic, i.e. the letter after the last letter in the alphabet, `Z`, is the first letter of the alphabet - `A`."
